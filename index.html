    <h1>Tachibana Makoto</h1>
      <h2>Professional Street Cat Cuddler</h2>
      <h2>About</h2>
        <p>From a young age, he had a fascination with the street cats that he would find on his walk to school. As the cats became less skittish, Makoto was excited to be able to pet them, and eventually start feeding them bits of his lunch. Throughout high school and college, Makoto volunteered at animal rescue clinics, in addition to creating 'Safe Spots for Street Cats' for street cats around Tokyo to hang out. As a graduate from Tokyo University with a double degree in Literature and Animal Sciences, Makoto is ready to take on the next adventure as a professional street cat cuddler on the streets of Tokyo. He is already familiar with all shelters in the area, as well as most of the street cats living in the vicinity of the city.</p>
